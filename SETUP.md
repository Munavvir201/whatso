# WhatsApp Application Setup Guide

## Issues Fixed ✅

1. **Build Error**: Missing `opus-media-recorder` dependency - RESOLVED
2. **TypeScript Errors**: Fixed null checking and type definitions - RESOLVED
3. **Security Updates**: Updated Next.js to latest version - IMPROVED

## Required Configuration

### Firebase Admin SDK Setup

Your application requires Firebase Admin SDK credentials for server-side operations. Currently missing from `.env.local`:

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Navigate to Project Settings > Service Accounts
3. Click "Generate new private key"
4. Add these variables to your `.env.local` file:

```env
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=whatso-7wxaj
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-service-account@whatso-7wxaj.iam.gserviceaccount.com
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
Your private key here
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"
```

### Remaining Tasks

1. **Fix ESLint Issues** (Optional - for code quality):
   - Remove unused variables
   - Escape HTML entities in JSX
   - Replace `any` types with proper TypeScript types

2. **Security Vulnerabilities** (14 remaining):
   - Most are in dev dependencies and don't affect production
   - Run `npm audit` to see details

## Current Status

✅ **Application builds successfully**  
✅ **Firebase client-side config is complete**  
⚠️  **Missing Firebase Admin SDK credentials** (required for production)  
✅ **TypeScript errors resolved**  
⚠️  **Some security vulnerabilities remain**  

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the application
npm run build

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

## Production Deployment

Before deploying to production:
1. Add Firebase Admin SDK credentials to your environment
2. Set up proper environment variables on your hosting platform
3. Consider running `npm audit fix --force` to address remaining vulnerabilities
